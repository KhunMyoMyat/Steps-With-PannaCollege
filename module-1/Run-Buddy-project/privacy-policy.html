Dispute Resolution. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</p>
        <p>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.</p>
        <p>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: 55 Main Street, Some Town, CA, 12345. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which either party is entitled.</p>
        <p>Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association, an established alternative dispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</p>
        <p>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</p>
        <p>Time Limits. If you or the Company pursues arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</p>
        <p>Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.</p>
        <p>Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less expensive than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>
        <p>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. All claims and disputes within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated or litigated on an individual basis and not on a class basis, and claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer or user.</p>
        <p>Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p>
        <p>Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
        <p>Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
        <p>Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.</p>
        <p>Small Claims Court. Nonetheless the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p>
        <p>Emergency Equitable Relief. Anyhow the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
        <p>Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other partyâ€™s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
        <p>In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Netherlands County, California, for such purposes.</p>
        <p>The Site may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not to export, re-export, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from Company, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.</p>
        <p>Company is located at the address in Section 10.8. If you are a California resident, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Product of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.</p>

For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from Company in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Company provides to you electronically satisfy any legal obligation that such communications would satisfy if it were be in a hard copy writing.</p>
        <p>Entire Terms. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Site. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word "including" means "including without limitation". If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to Company is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Companyâ€™s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.

Using the &lt;i&gt; Tag

&lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt; text.&lt;/p&gt;
Using the &lt;em&gt; Tag

&lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;em&gt;italic&lt;/em&gt; text.&lt;/p&gt;
Difference Between &lt;i&gt; and &lt;em&gt;


The &lt;i&gt; tag is used for text that is stylistically different from normal text (like italics) but does not convey any special emphasis.

The &lt;em&gt; tag is used to indicate emphasis, which can be important for accessibility and SEO.


Example

Here's a complete HTML example:
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Italic Text Example&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is normal text, and this is &lt;i&gt;italic text using the i tag&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is also normal text, but this is &lt;em&gt;italic text using the em tag&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
You can choose either method depending on your needs!

how to put button in the center?
GPT-4o Mini
To center a button in HTML, you can use a combination of CSS properties. Here are a few methods you can use:
Method 1: Using Flexbox

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Center Button Example&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
        .container {
            display: flex;
            justify-content: center; /* Center horizontally */
            align-items: center; /* Center vertically (if container has height) */
            height: 100vh; /* Full height of the viewport */
        }
    &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
        &lt;button&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
Method 2: Using Text Alignment

If you only want to center the button horizontally within a block-level element:
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Center Button Example&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
        .container {
            text-align: center; /* Center text and inline elements */
            margin-top: 50px; /* Optional: add some top margin */
        }
    &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
        &lt;button&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
Method 3: Using Margin Auto

You can also center the button by setting its margins to auto and defining its display as block:
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Center Button Example&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
        button {
            display: block; /* Makes button a block element */
            margin:  auto; /* Center button using auto margins */
        }
    &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;button&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
Summary


Flexbox: Use this method if you need to center both horizontally and vertically.

Text Alignment: Simple and effective for horizontal centering.

Margin Auto: Good for block-level centering.

GPT-4o Mini
The error message you're encountering indicates that you're trying to push a file (`thumbnails/SlackSetup.exe`) that exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100 MB. To resolve this issue, you can use Git Large File Storage (Git LFS), which allows you to manage large files more effectively in your Git repositories. Here’s how to set it up:
Step 1: Install Git LFS

If you haven't already installed Git LFS, you'll need to do that first. You can download and install it from the [Git LFS website](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
For example, on macOS, you can install it using Homebrew:
brew install git-lfs
Or on Ubuntu, you can use:
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
Step 2: Initialize Git LFS

After installing, you need to initialize it in your repository:
git lfs install
Step 3: Track Large Files

Specify which file types or specific files you want Git LFS to manage. For your case, to track `.exe` files, you can run:
git lfs track "*.exe"
This command creates or updates a `.gitattributes` file in your repository to include the specified file types.
Step 4: Add and Commit Changes

You will need to add the `.gitattributes` file and your large file again:
git add .gitattributes
git add thumbnails/SlackSetup.exe
git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS"
Step 5: Push Your Changes

Now, try pushing your changes again:
git push origin main
Step 6: Verify

After the push completes, verify that your large files are now being tracked by Git LFS by checking the status of your repository or the GitHub repository.
Important Note

If you've previously pushed the large file without using LFS, you may need to remove the large file from your history. You can do this using the following commands, but be cautious as it rewrites history:
git rm --cached thumbnails/SlackSetup.exe
git commit -m "Remove large file from history"
Then, add it back using LFS tracking and push again.
Further Reading

For more details on using Git LFS, you can refer to the [Git LFS documentation](https://git-lfs.github.com/) or check the [GitHub documentation on LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/versioning-large-files).

hot to solve this
GPT-4o Mini
The error message you're encountering indicates that your local branch (`main`) is behind the remote branch (`main` on GitHub), meaning there are changes on the remote repository that you do not have in your local repository. To resolve this issue, you need to fetch and integrate the changes from the remote repository before you can push your own changes. Here are the steps to follow:
Step 1: Fetch the Latest Changes

First, you should fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:
git fetch origin
This will retrieve the changes from the remote without merging them into your local branch.
Step 2: Merge Changes into Your Local Branch

Next, you need to merge the changes into your local branch. You can do this by running:
git merge origin/main
This will bring the changes from the remote `main` branch into your local `main` branch. If there are any merge conflicts, Git will prompt you to resolve them at this point.
Step 3: Resolve Any Merge Conflicts (if applicable)

If there are any merge conflicts, you will need to resolve them manually. Open the files with conflicts, make the necessary changes, then stage the resolved files:
git add <file_with_conflict>
After resolving any conflicts, commit your changes:
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
Step 4: Push Your Changes

Once your local branch is up-to-date with the remote and all conflicts are resolved, you can push your changes:
git push origin main
Alternative: Rebase Instead of Merge

If you prefer a cleaner history, you can use rebase instead of merge:
git pull --rebase origin main
This will apply your changes on top of the current changes from the remote branch. After resolving any conflicts, you can push your changes:
git push origin main
Summary


Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository.

Merge (or rebase) the changes into your local branch.

Resolve any conflicts, if necessary.

Push your changes to the remote repository.


By following these steps, you should be able to successfully push your changes to the remote repository.
